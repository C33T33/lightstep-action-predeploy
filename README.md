# lightstep-action-predeploy

The `lightstep/lightstep-action-predeploy` action leverages publicly-available partner and Lightstep APIs to provide insight into the health of production service(s) during software delivery. 

The Javascript-based action runs when a pull request is approved by GitHub reviewers and uses APIs to provide a summary of deployment risk ahead of a code change going to a production environment.
